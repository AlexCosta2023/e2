+ By: Alex Costa
+ URL: <http://e2p1.alexandercosta.net>

## Game planning

+ Create an array of six options (1-20)
+ Randomly choose one of these options TWICE from the array and assign both to Player A's move
+ Do the same for Player B so both Player A and Player B have two numbers assigned to each player.
+ Add Player A's two numbers together and the sum is the total points they have.
+ Do the same math for Player B to receive sum.
+ Compare both sum values and whichever player has the most points wins.
+ Report the results of the four rolls, the sum of their points, and the winner to the page.
