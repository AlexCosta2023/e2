## Project Description

This app is a 20-sided dice game where two players (Player A and Player B) compete against each other. Users can choose to play 5, 10, or 25 games, and the results are displayed for each game, including the dice rolls and the winner.

## Code Description

This file contains the HTML structure of the application. It uses Bootstrap for styling and displays the form to select the number of games, as well as the results after the games have been played.
- **process.php:** 
This file contains the PHP logic for playing the games. It handles the POST request from the form, plays the games, and includes the results in the response.
